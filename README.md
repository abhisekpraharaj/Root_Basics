# Root_Basics
There is information in the PPT file about ROOT Framework and how to use it. There are 3 different files in this repository, such as "xyz.c", "xyz.root", and "xyz.dat". ".c" files are mostly code files, while ".root" files are special files used in the root framework service and ".dat" files are used to store data.

Here are some.c or code files that explain the code file:
errgr.c: drawing the graph with an error bar

gittut4.c: To define two user-defined functions

Histobin.c: Make a graph with 200 bins and find the one with the most data.

tut4.c: Use a prepared data file to draw a graph.(data2.txt)

tut20.c is a plot of a curve with error bars.

tut111.c shows how to make a root file and put a histogram in it.

tut67.c: This histogram is read from the tree file that was stated in tut111.

twodist.c: Making a 2d Histogram.

trex1.c: Making a Root file, making a Tree file inside it, and giving the Tree branches and assigning values in that branches.

readtree.c: Reads the tree file that was defined in trex1.c.

The paci1.root , paci_2.root, paci_3.root, paci_4.root, paci_5.root files includes the data files and values of the._peru_1_Ge10.dat,._peru_1_Ge11.dat,._peru_1_NaI.dat,._QA_Ge10.dat, and._QA_Ge11.dat files.
